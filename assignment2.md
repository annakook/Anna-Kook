# Defending a data source / Apr 18, 2018
**Key Question**: What is the most dangerous neighborhood to live in Chicago? 
To answer this question, I looked at the [set of data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g) provided by the Chicago Data Portal.  The page includes information and summarized data from 2001 â€“ 2018 on all reported crimes in Chicago including number of crimes reported in each location by zip codes and wards. 

This data is trustworthy first of all because it is provided by the City of Chicago, so all of the data sets are provided through the police department in Chicago. Nonetheless, this brings me to a factor we should consider when viewing the data is that it does not include information about unreported crimes. Therefore, some neighborhoods in Chicago may seem safer than they actually are. 

The data is also reliable in terms of timeliness, and we could draw conclusions from it on the current environment in Chicago because the latest data entered was on April 10, 2018. Furthermore, because the information runs from 2001 to the current day, there are pretty accurate trends I can draw about the overall crime rates within different areas in Chicago. 

Furthermore, every single reported crime of 6,578,254 crimes is listed that goes along with a description, the location where it occurred and the type of crime. Therefore, a further conclusion can be made about what kind of crimes have been increasing/decreasing in specific areas narrowed down to the exact street.

The NJ.com article reported on data released by Bureau of Labor Statistics that indicated average hourly earning of New Jersey employees increased by 4% over the past year. It was very clear that the data came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics because it was cited in the second paragraph of the story, and is linked. The article also features an image in the middle of the article of the data map from Labor Statistics. I liked that the story broke down what the data meant in real life. For example, they were clear on the fact that the data on “average hourly earning” can skew the overall picture. This is because the jobs that are actually increasing in its wages the most are the highly skills jobs such as “legal, scientific and computer jobs.” This brings me to my next point that I don’t like about the article because their lead reads, “New Jersey workers now have a few more bucks in their pocket,” which makes it seem like all workers in New Jersey have more disposable income to spend while this is not necessarily the case. Something that’s confusing about the article is that it goes on to discuss how New Jersey fails to attract young people in the highly skills jobs. I understand they mention this because a lack of supply of people with high skills leads to a drive in wages. But this point was not made very clear in the article. Also, the argument that New Jersey is not an urban community that fails to attract young people is not very convincing as it is a generalizing statement that is not entirely true.
